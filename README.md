#Assignment 9:
1b: Event bubbling and event capturing are two different methods of handling events in the DOM (Document Object Model). Event bubbling is the most common method and it means that events are first handled by the innermost element and then propagated to its outer ancestor elements. In contrast, event capturing handles events from the outermost ancestor element to the innermost element.

An example scenario where event capturing would occur is when we have a form and we want to validate the user's input before submitting it. We would use event capturing to validate the input first, and then submit the form.

An example scenario where event bubbling would occur is when we have a dropdown menu. If we click on an option in the dropdown menu, we want the menu to close and the selected option to be displayed. In this case, we would use event bubbling to close the menu first, and then handle the selection of the option.


2b: Event propagation is the process by which events are handled by multiple elements in the DOM hierarchy. When an event is triggered on an element, it can be handled by that element, its parent elements, and the document object itself. This is known as event propagation or event bubbling.
