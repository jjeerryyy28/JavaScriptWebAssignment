  <script>
    function extractTitleAndAuthor(books, ...restArgs) {
      const newBooks = books.map(({title, author}) => ({title, author}));
      console.log(...newBooks, ...restArgs);
    }

    // Example usage
    const books = [
      {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', year: 1925},
      {title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird', author: 'Harper Lee', year: 1960},
      {title: '1984', author: 'George Orwell', year: 1949}
    ];

    extractTitleAndAuthor(books, 'Additional argument 1', 'Additional argument 2');

<!-- The extractTitleAndAuthor function takes an array of objects called books as its parameter and uses the rest parameter (...restArgs) to capture any additional arguments passed to the function.
It then uses array destructuring to extract the title and author properties from each object in the books array.
It uses arrow functions and the map method to create a new array of objects that only contain the title and author properties.
Finally, it uses the spread operator (...) to pass the new array of objects and any additional arguments to a console.log statement.
The example usage creates an array of books and calls the extractTitleAndAuthor function with the books array and two additional arguments.

Difference between normal functions and arrow functions:

Normal functions have their own this keyword, while arrow functions inherit the this keyword from their parent scope.
Arrow functions have a shorter syntax and are more concise than normal functions, making them easier to read and write.
Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and do not have their own arguments object. -->
